\chapter{Situation}
\section{Problem statement}

The world competition of COVID-19 medicine collection was a fail. The method of making two people fight at a time was a really slow process, shortage of available vaccine was becoming visible and the winners were sometimes just lucky! To solve the problem and distribute vaccine faster and decimate the population, a twisted free for all was started. 10 people were released in the maze at once and whoever collected $k$ medicines out of the $n$ medicines stationed at different places in the maze and reached the end was declared the winner and rest were shot dead. This method was quicker and matched the vaccine production rate. The twisted money minded officials approved of this format for the game of life.

The instructions given to players were to ignore other 9 participants (so that they don't sabotage each other and win based on merit). They were given a map of the maze marked with the location of objectives 2 minutes before the map. Assuming that the walking/running speed is not a deciding factor of winning the competition, find the fastest way to collect the $k$ objectives first and reach the end of the maze before other competitors without wasting all the time on thinking.

\section{Mathematical Interpretation of the Problem Statement}

An $m\times m$ sized maze is given with a total of $n$ objectives. Player starts at the entry gate. The motive is to collect $k$ out of the $n$ objectives and reach the end gate before the others. Find the most efficient path from start to end collecting
